            cilantro. Baked until golden and bubbly, Mexican pizza offers a spicy kick and a satisfying crunch, making

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat 2 pie plates with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Place ground beef, onion, and garlic in a skillet over medium heat. Cook until beef is evenly browned
                and
                crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Season beef with chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt,
                and
                pepper.</li>
            <li>Lay one tortilla in each pie plate, and cover with a layer of refried beans. Spread 1/2 of the seasoned
                ground beef over each one, and then cover with a second tortilla. Bake in the preheated oven until
                tortillas
                are crisp, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pizzas from the oven and set aside to cool slightly. Then spread 1/2 of the salsa over each top
                tortilla. Cover each pizza with 1/2 of the Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses. Place 1/2 of the tomatoes,
                1/2
                of the green onions, and 1/2 of the jalapeño slices onto each one.</li>
            <li>Return pizzas to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, about 5 to 10 more minutes. Let pizzas cool
                slightly before slicing each one into 4 pieces. </li>
        </ol>
